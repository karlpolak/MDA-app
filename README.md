# Explanation
Water security appears increasingly around the globe and one of the most prominent issues is increasing water stress. The term 'water stress' is rather vague on thus the FAO (Federal & Agricultural Organization) of the UN (United Nations) has defined it as follows:

Water stress is the freshwater withdrawal as a proportion (%) of available water resources. It is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental flow requirements. ([metadata](https://www.fao.org/aquastat/statistics/popups/itemDefn.html?id=4550))

The goal of this app is to display some insightful data on global water stress. It shows data obtained from the [World Bank Group](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/), which contains both climate and non-climate related data per year. In addition, the app also shows a projection up until 2032, which is computed by a Vector Auto Regression (VAR).
